# LoneWatcher

**LoneWatcher** is a lightweight, decentralized monitoring tool designed to run independently on a local system. It monitors critical services, pings IP addresses, and checks HTTP endpoints without relying on a central monitoring infrastructure. Ideal for quick, pragmatic system checks, LoneWatcher operates as a solitary sentinel to ensure essential components remain functional.

## Development

### Commands

- `make lint` - Run the linter to check code style.

## To Do

- prevent starting more than one instance (as setting)
- ping warning only if it fails n times in a row.
- Hardcode system information
- Log
  - start
  - end
  - switch between green and red
- Move "statuses" handling to GUI? This also would allow to optimize the `clear_highlight` function.
- Add Info button in GUI (with LICENSE, Author, Version and Repository URL)
- create Settings GUI - separate or in GUI
- watch config file or read config file periodically
- hostname specific config
- add linter and formatter / black
